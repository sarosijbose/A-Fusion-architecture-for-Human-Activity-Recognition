# An ensemble architecture for Human Activity Recognition

*DISCLAIMER: This repository is currently under development. We expect to make the entire codebase and utilities avaliable within the next week.

## Overview:-

This repository contains the implementation of this paper, currently under review in the Springer [2nd International Conference on Frontiers in Computing and Systems](https://comsysconf.org/index.html) (COMSYS-2021). 

## Setup:-

A. It is recommended to create a fresh virtual environment first.
```bash
python -m venv env
source activate env/bin/activate
```
Then install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
B. Directory structure overview
The codebase is divided into 5 folders. 

1. 3D CNN
This folder contains all the code necessary for running the Spatial 3D CNN Stream.
First convert the sample UCF-101 videos given in the ```sample videos``` folder into their required pre-processed format,
```bash
python pre_processing.py
```
This will convert the videos into the required .npy format.
Next, feed them *one-by-one* into the evaluation code for the results
```bash
python eval_sample_RGB.py
```
Make sure that the ```i3d.py``` file is present in the same directory and change the checkpoint path accordingly.
The Kinetics-RGB-600 checkpoint is avaliable within the ```checkpoint``` folder.

The top 5-predictions will be printed in the order of their prediction accuracy.
Here is a sample output for the video ```v_BabyCrawling_g18_c06```

2. 2D CNN
This folder contains the code for running the Spatial 2D CNN Stream.
Download the entire pre-processed RGB data made avaliable by Feichtenhofer here.
Next, directly feed the frames by running this,
```bash
python predict.py
```
3. Ensemble  
**Upcoming soon**

4. Data   
This folder contains all the required utilities and samples required for evaluation.

## Acknowledgements:-

Parts of the codebase and the Kinetics-RGB-600 checkpoint have been adapted from the [i3d](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d) repository. 
We are grateful to the authors for making their work avaliable.
