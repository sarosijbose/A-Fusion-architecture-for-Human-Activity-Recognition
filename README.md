# A Fusion architecture for Human Activity Recognition

*DISCLAIMER: This repository is currently under development. We expect to make the entire codebase and utilities avaliable within the next week.*

## About:-

This repository contains the implementation of this paper, currently under review in IEEE [INDICON](https://www.ewh.ieee.org/r10/calcutta/indicon2021/index.html) 2021. 

## Setup:-  

A. Clone the repository first.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarosijbose/An-ensemble-architecture-for-Human-Activity-Recognition.git
```

B. It is then recommended to create a fresh virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv env
source activate env/bin/activate
```
Then install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
C. Directory structure overview  
The codebase is divided into 5 folders. 

1. 3D CNN  
This folder contains all the code necessary for running the Spatial 3D CNN Stream.
First convert the sample UCF-101 videos given in the ```sample videos``` folder into their required pre-processed format,
```bash
python pre_processing.py
```
This will convert the videos into the required .npy format.
Next, feed them *one-by-one* into the evaluation code for the results
```bash
python eval_sample_RGB.py
```
Make sure that the ```i3d.py``` file is present in the same directory and change the checkpoint path accordingly.
The Kinetics-RGB-600 checkpoint is avaliable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLwYRzp7Aei1qtNhOcq5C4cnjD27A845?usp=sharing).

The top 5-predictions will be printed in the order of their prediction accuracy.
Here is a sample output for the video ```v_BrushingTeeth_g17_c02.npy```

2. 2D CNN  
This folder contains the code for running the Spatial 2D CNN Stream.

Next, directly feed the frames by running this,
```bash
python eval2dcnn.py
```
Here is a sample output:-

Download the entire pre-processed RGB data made avaliable by Feichtenhofer [here](http://ftp.tugraz.at/pub/feichtenhofer/tsfusion/data/) if you want to fine-tune on UCF-101.

3. Average the softmax scores of each stream.
```bash
python average_fusion.py
```
4. Data   
This folder contains all the required utilities and samples required for evaluation.

## Acknowledgements:-

Parts of the codebase and the RGB-600 checkpoint have been adapted from the [Kinetics](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d) repository. 
We are grateful to the authors for making their work avaliable.
